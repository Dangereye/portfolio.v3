A clean, responsive single page application that offers a concise snapshot of who I am, what I do, and how I work. Built to showcase my skills, reflect my journey, and serve as a central hub for potential clients and collaborators.

This project reflects my commitment to writing clean, scalable code and building thoughtful, user focused digital experiences.

## Design
