A clean, responsive single page application that offers a concise snapshot of who I am, what I do, and how I work. Built to showcase my skills, reflect my journey, and serve as a central hub for potential clients and collaborators.

This project reflects my commitment to writing clean, scalable code and building thoughtful, user focused digital experiences.

## Design

The goal was to create a modern, elegant design with smooth transitions and a layout thatâ€™s easy to navigate for both technical and non technical users.

## Features

- Single page application (SPA)
- Responsive layout and optimised images
- Custom SVG icons
- Mobile friendly toggle menu
- Smooth scroll navigation
- GSAP animation and scroll triggers

## Project Focus

This project gave me the chance to put several established skills into practice, including working with TypeScript in a React environment and applying GSAP for smooth, performant animation. It also helped me refine my approach to structure, responsiveness and creating a polished user experience.
